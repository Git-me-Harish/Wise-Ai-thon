## Project Overview
The **Smart Agriculture Advisor** is an AI-powered application designed to provide personalized farming advice. The system analyzes multiple data sources, such as soil conditions, weather forecasts, crop types, and historical yield data, to offer recommendations to farmers. This tool aims to improve farming efficiency and crop yield by providing real-time, data-driven suggestions.

Farmers can input data directly through the user-friendly frontend, and the application generates tailored recommendations to optimize farming practices.

---

## Features
- **Soil Analysis**: Analyze soil properties such as pH level, nutrient content, and moisture level to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Incorporates real-time weather data to give timely advice on irrigation, planting, and harvesting schedules.
- **Crop Recommendations**: Suggests the most suitable crops to plant based on soil and weather conditions.
- **Yield Prediction**: Predicts crop yield based on historical data and current conditions.
- **Data Input Interface**: A simple, interactive frontend for farmers to enter data and receive personalized farming advice.

---

## Architecture

The **Smart Agriculture Advisor** follows a modular architecture that integrates the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion Module**:
   - Collects and preprocesses soil, weather, and crop yield data.
   
2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - AI models to analyze the data and provide predictive recommendations.

3. **Frontend**:
   - A user-friendly web interface for farmers to input data and retrieve suggestions.

4. **Backend**:
   - Handles all the logic, data processing, and communication between the frontend and the machine learning model.

---

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the UI.
- **JavaScript**: For frontend logic and interactions.
- **React.js** (optional): If you want a dynamic single-page application.

### Backend:
- **Python**: Main language for building the backend.
- **Flask/Django**: Framework to serve as the web application backend.
- **RESTful API**: To facilitate communication between frontend and backend.

### Machine Learning/AI:
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the recommendation model.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For more complex deep learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: For storing farmer data, historical yield data, and recommendations.
- **SQLite**: For lightweight local storage during development.

### Others:
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- **Heroku/AWS/GCP**: For cloud deployment.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Git-me-Harish/Wise-Ai-thon.git
cd Wise-Ai-thon
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary keys like database credentials, weather API keys, etc.

### 5. Run the application:
```bash
flask run  # or django-admin runserver for Django
```

## Usage

1. **Access the Frontend**: 
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you configured) to access the input form.
   
2. **Input Data**: 
   Farmers can input data such as soil type, moisture level, crop type, and weather data.

3. **Get Recommendations**: 
   After submitting the data, the system processes the information and displays personalized farming advice.

---

## Dataset

The system relies on a combination of soil data, weather data, and historical crop yield data.

- **Soil Data**: pH, nitrogen content, moisture level, etc.
- **Weather Data**: Real-time weather conditions from an external weather API.
- **Crop Yield Data**: Historical data on crop performance based on different soil and weather conditions.

---

## Model Training

The machine learning model is built using a combination of **regression** and **classification algorithms**. Here's the pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize soil data and encode categorical features like crop types.
2. **Model Selection**:
   - **Random Forest**: For yield prediction based on historical data.
   - **KNN/SVM**: For crop recommendations based on soil conditions.
3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained on historical data and validated using k-fold cross-validation.
4. **Evaluation**: Model accuracy is evaluated using metrics like **RMSE** for regression and **precision/recall** for classification.

---

## Frontend

The frontend is designed for ease of use, with:
- **Input Forms**: For farmers to enter relevant data (soil, weather, crop type).
- **Results Page**: Displays the farming advice in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format.

---

## Backend

The backend processes all the incoming data, communicates with the machine learning model, and provides the recommendation. It also integrates external APIs for real-time weather data.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile application for easier data entry by farmers.
- **Additional Data Integration**: Incorporate satellite imagery and IoT sensor data for more accurate predictions.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend support for multiple languages to reach more farmers.
- **AI Chatbot**: Include a chatbot interface to answer farmer queries in real time.
